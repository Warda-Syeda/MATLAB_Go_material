%% MATLAB Beginners Course Notes 3
% Loops

%% Challenge #1
% Using the worked example as a guide, write a script places each Pokemon on 
% the map for 1 sec and then places the next pokemon on the same figure. 
% Hint: check documentation for ?pause? function
% Change your loop so that it only displays only pokemons 4,7,13,16,28
% and 33 for a second and then closes the figure.

%% Challenge 1 - Extension

% Modify your loop to instead place multiple pokemons on the same figure. 
% Hint: Open placePokemon function and study the for loop implemented in it. 
% Save this figure as a png file to disk and tweet in! Don?t forget to use @ResPlat :D


%% Challenge #2

% Insert for loop so that the script loads in each data file sequentially, 
% and saves out a figure of Pokemon placed on map.
% HINT: loop using the variable idx.

%% Challenge 3

% Open pie_script2.m and debug it

%% Challenge 3 - Extension

% if you're feeling creative, add a pie chart to the code to show 
% how much pie has been eaten!
